# Architecture Decision Document — FlavorLab™

_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._

---

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements — 11 FRs across 4 capability domains:**

| Domain | FRs | Architectural Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Search & Pairing Engine | FR-01, FR-02, FR-08, FR-09 | High — ≤300ms p95, multi-signal scoring, fuzzy match, provenance tracking |
| Community & Scoring | FR-03, FR-04 | High — eventually consistent, velocity spike detection, quarantine model, moderation |
| Personalisation & UX | FR-05, FR-06, FR-07 | Medium — localStorage-based, mobile responsive, no auth required |
| Pro / API tier | FR-10, FR-11 | Medium now, High post-MVP — versioned API, rate limiting, PDF generation |

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Search ≤300ms p95 — requires pre-computed pairings, Redis cache, no runtime graph traversal
- Autocomplete ≤100ms p95 — separate minimal in-memory index
- Page load ≤2s on 4G mobile — Vite build optimisation, lazy-loaded science card content
- API uptime ≥99.5% — graceful degradation when DB unavailable
- Scale: 50,000+ ingredient documents, 10M+ rating records without index redesign
- Security: OWASP Top 10, rate limiting all public endpoints
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA, `prefers-reduced-motion` on all animations
- Legal: zero hallucinated pairings, data provenance per compound association (DR-01)

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

**Frontend:**
- Marketing page (`flavorlab.io`) stays vanilla JS / Vite as-is — no changes
- Product app (`flavorlab.io/app`) is a new separate build using a framework (TBD in Step 3)
- Both served from the same domain for SEO authority consolidation

**Data pipeline:**
- Only FlavorGraph's 35,440 chemical edges qualify for Science Score — recipe co-occurrence edges (111,355) explicitly excluded from Science Score signal
- Every compound-ingredient link carries a confidence tier enforced as a Postgres ENUM constraint: `GC_MS_EXPERIMENTAL` | `LITERATURE_CURATED` | `ML_PREDICTED` | `RECIPE_CO_OCCURRENCE`
- Multi-source ETL: FlavorGraph CSVs + Flavornet + ChemTastesDB + PubChem API enrichment
- ETL must be idempotent — stable pairing edge IDs survive re-seeds

**Scoring:**
- 5 signals stored separately per pairing edge (compound_affinity, graph_similarity, category_affinity, popularity, editorial_boost)
- Formula weights adjustable without re-ETL; score version tracked for cache invalidation

### Confirmed Architectural Decisions (from context analysis)

| # | Decision | Choice |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Frontend | Marketing stays vanilla JS; product app is new framework-based build |
| 2 | Domain | Same domain — `flavorlab.io` (marketing) + `flavorlab.io/app` (product) |
| 3 | Free tier identity | Two-tier: (a) anonymous session token for browsing/searching — HTTP-only cookie, Redis-backed, 30-day TTL; (b) email-verified rater — email + OTP verification required to submit ratings, email stored in localStorage after first verification |
| 4 | Auth provider | Better Auth — open source, self-hosted, runs on existing Postgres, zero cost |
| 5 | Autocomplete | In-memory prefix index (MVP); abstracted interface for Typesense swap at Growth |
| 6 | Embeddings | FlavorGraph pre-existing Node2Vec (MVP, Apache 2.0); sentence-transformers Phase 2 |
| 7 | Primary DB | Postgres + pgvector + Redis — single DB engine, no MongoDB |
| 8 | Hive Score recalc | Debounced event-driven (≤5 min) + nightly full batch — async, no request latency impact |
| 9 | API surfaces | Two surfaces: `/api/v1/` internal + `/public/v1/` external enterprise; shared service layer |
| 10 | Pairing edge ID | Composite stable key: alphabetically sorted canonical names (`garlic:rosemary`) |

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. **Science integrity gate** — DB-level constraint prevents recipe co-occurrence data from appearing in Science Score
2. **Provenance chain** — UI → API → DB → source dataset traceable via `confidence_tier` + `source_citation` fields
3. **Versioned scoring** — Score version field on pairing edges; formula change triggers Redis cache invalidation via versioned keys
4. **Geographic context flags** — Pairings carry cuisine context and food pairing hypothesis applicability (Western validated / East Asian negative correlation / Not validated)
5. **Graceful degradation** — Structured error states when Postgres or Redis unavailable; no silent empty results
6. **ETL idempotency** — `etl_version` + `etl_run_id` per record; upsert semantics throughout
7. **Rating integrity** — Email verification required to rate (OTP flow); email stored in localStorage post-verification to skip re-verification; `rater_email` stored on every `rating_event` record; per-email daily limit + velocity spike detection + new-email weight decay (7-day cool-off on first N ratings)
8. **Two API surfaces** — Internal presentation API and external enterprise API share service layer but differ in response serialisation and auth

### Scale & Complexity Assessment

- **Complexity level:** High
- **Primary domain:** Full-stack SaaS with data pipeline core — ETL and scoring engine are as important as the API
- **Estimated architectural components:** 9 — ETL pipeline, Ingredient Ontology Service, Postgres data layer, pgvector embedding layer, Redis cache layer, scoring engine, community ratings service, internal REST API, external enterprise REST API
- **Highest risk component:** Multi-source ETL with confidence tier tracking — Ingredient Ontology Service (canonical name normalisation across FlavorGraph/FooDB/PubChem naming conventions) is the most complex and most consequential pre-work

---

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

**Full-stack SaaS** with clean frontend/backend separation. The backend complexity (multi-signal scoring engine, ETL pipeline, two versioned API surfaces, community ratings, background jobs) justifies an enterprise-grade backend framework. The frontend is a pure SPA — no SSR required, all data is API-fetched.

### Starter Options Considered

| Option | TypeScript DX | BE Complexity Fit | FE Fit | Ops | Scale | Team Fit | **Score** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **pnpm workspaces + Vite + NestJS** ✅ | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | **4.45** |
| Turborepo + Vite + NestJS | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4.10 |
| Next.js full-stack | 4 | 2 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 3.50 |
| Vite + Express/Fastify | 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 3.55 |
| SvelteKit + NestJS | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 3.65 |
| Vite + Hono | 4 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 3.45 |

**Why not Next.js full-stack:** Next.js API routes run as stateless serverless functions — fundamentally incompatible with BullMQ workers (persistent process), nightly batch scoring recalculations, and Redis connection pooling. Adding a separate worker service alongside Next.js produces three deployment units instead of two, with a useless BFF middleman layer.

**Why not Turborepo:** Windows 11 development environment introduces path-handling risk. pnpm workspaces with file-reference packages provides the same shared types benefit (`"@flavorlab/types": "file:../../packages/shared-types"`) with zero orchestration overhead. Turborepo build caching can be added later when CI/CD is established.

**Why Drizzle over TypeORM:** Drizzle schema definitions ARE TypeScript types — no decorator magic, no `@Entity()`, no class inheritance. `typeof ingredients.$inferSelect` produces the correct type automatically and is importable into the shared-types package. TypeORM entities require a live DB connection to instantiate properly, making unit tests slower and more complex. Critical for the scoring engine test pyramid.

### Selected Starter: pnpm workspaces + Vite React + NestJS + Drizzle ORM

**Rationale:**
- Vite + React — consistent with marketing page toolchain; SPA is correct for product app (no SSR needed); TypeScript template ready
- NestJS — module system, DI container, Guards, Pipes, versioned routing, BullMQ integration; all map directly to FlavorLab™'s service architecture
- Drizzle ORM — schema IS the TypeScript type; superior inference; pgvector column support; healthier test pyramid
- pnpm workspaces — shared `@flavorlab/types` package enforces API contract between frontend and backend; Windows-safe; zero additional tooling

**Initialization Commands:**

```bash
# Step 1: Bootstrap pnpm workspace monorepo
mkdir flavorlab && cd flavorlab
pnpm init
echo "packages:\n  - 'apps/*'\n  - 'packages/*'" > pnpm-workspace.yaml

# Step 2: Product app frontend
npm create vite@latest apps/web -- --template react-ts

# Step 3: Backend API
npx @nestjs/cli@latest new apps/api --package-manager pnpm

# Step 4: Shared types package
mkdir -p packages/shared-types && cd packages/shared-types && pnpm init

# Step 5: Add Drizzle ORM to API
cd ../../apps/api
pnpm add drizzle-orm pg && pnpm add -D drizzle-kit @types/pg
```

**Resulting workspace structure:**

```
flavorlab/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                    # Vite + React + TS → flavorlab.io/app

└── scoring/                    # Pure TS scoring engine (zero framework deps)
```

### Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter

**Language & Runtime:**
- TypeScript 5.x throughout — strict mode, shared `tsconfig` base in `packages/shared-config`
- Node.js runtime (NestJS API), browser target (Vite SPA)

**Styling Solution:**
- No opinion from starter — product app will use CSS Modules or Tailwind (TBD in UX Design phase)
- Marketing page retains its existing flat CSS — no change

**Build Tooling:**
- Frontend: Vite 5.x — HMR, ESM, optimised production bundles
- Backend: NestJS CLI / tsc — watch mode for development
- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces — no build cache tooling at MVP; add Turborepo post-launch

**Testing Framework:**
- NestJS: Jest (included by default)
- Frontend: Vitest (same config as Vite, add as dev dependency)
- E2E: Playwright (add post-Sprint 1)
- Test pyramid: Unit (Vitest, pure functions) → Integration (NestJS test module + test Postgres container) → E2E (Playwright)

**Development Experience:**
- `pnpm dev` — starts both Vite dev server (port 5174) and NestJS watch mode (port 3000) in parallel
- Hot reload on frontend; NestJS `--watch` flag on backend
- Shared types auto-resolved via workspace path references
- `@nestjs/cli` scaffold commands for new modules

### Implementation Principles (from A+P analysis)

1. **Scoring engine isolation** — The scoring algorithm (`compound_affinity × 0.35 + graph_similarity × 0.25 + ...`) lives in `apps/api/src/scoring/` as a pure TypeScript function. Zero NestJS decorators, zero Drizzle imports. Input: signal values. Output: weighted score. Independently unit-testable, independently replaceable.

2. **`confidence_tier` ENUM in schema from Sprint 1** — Drizzle schema includes `pgEnum('confidence_tier', ['GC_MS_EXPERIMENTAL', 'LITERATURE_CURATED', 'ML_PREDICTED', 'RECIPE_CO_OCCURRENCE'])` from day one. Not a Sprint 3 refinement — it's the data integrity differentiator and science honesty guarantee.

3. **Skeleton states as UI convention** — Product app uses skeleton loading states (not spinners, not blank screens) for all async data fetches. Established as a project-wide convention in Sprint 1, applied to every data-dependent component.

4. **Deployment catch-all routing** — Vite SPA requires server-side catch-all (`/*` → `index.html`) to support direct URL access (e.g. `/app/ingredient/garlic`). Configured in Nginx/Caddy deployment config, not a code change.

**Note:** Project initialization using the commands above is the first implementation story in Epic 1, Story 1.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**
- Drizzle migration strategy — versioned files, auto-run on startup
- Zod validation — at all API boundaries before DB touch
- Redis cache key design — versioned keys for score invalidation
- Authorization tier model — Guards + ApiKeyStrategy from Sprint 1
- Rate limiting — all public endpoints, Redis-backed

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**
- TanStack Query + Zustand for frontend state
- TanStack Router for typed client-side routing
- shadcn/ui component library
- Tailwind CSS v4 for product app
- Cursor-based pagination
- Global ExceptionFilter for error response standard
- Structured logging via nestjs-pino

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**
- Real-time Hive Score updates (SSE/WebSocket) — 30s polling sufficient at MVP
- Turborepo build caching — add when CI/CD is established
- Full monitoring stack (Sentry/Datadog) — flagged in post-mvp-tasks.md as 5B
- Qdrant migration — only if pgvector latency exceeds 300ms p95 under load

---

### Data Architecture

#### Migrations
- **Tool:** `drizzle-kit generate` → versioned SQL migration files committed to git
- **Execution:** `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` `migrate()` runs automatically on app startup
- **Rationale:** Only production-safe approach; `push` mode is dev-only. Migration history is the source of truth for schema state.

#### Data Validation
- **Tool:** Zod throughout — API input, environment variables, shared type schemas
- **NestJS integration:** `nestjs-zod` adapter bridges Zod schemas into NestJS validation pipes
- **Rationale:** Consistent with Drizzle's no-decorator philosophy; works in both API and frontend (form validation); Zod schemas in `shared-types` are reusable across the monorepo

#### Redis Caching Strategy

| Cache key pattern | TTL | Invalidation trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `pairing:{id}:v{scoreVersion}` | 24h | Score formula version change |
| `ingredient:{canonicalName}:top50` | 6h | ETL re-seed |
| `autocomplete:prefix:{prefix}` | 1h | Ingredient ontology update |
| `session:{token}` | 30d | Explicit logout |
| `ratelimit:{ip}:{endpoint}` | 60s | Rolling window |

Score version embedded in cache key means formula changes auto-invalidate without a manual flush script.

#### DB Read Strategy
- **Approach:** Normalised `pairings` table with Postgres partial index on `(ingredient_a, ingredient_b, score DESC)`
- **Read path:** Redis cache hit → return; miss → Postgres query → Redis SET → return
- **Rationale:** Avoid pre-computed denormalisation — let Redis be the read cache layer. Normalised schema supports ETL re-seeds without orphaning data.

---

### Authentication & Security

#### Authorization Tier Model
```
Anonymous (browsing)   → session token cookie only (Redis-backed, 30-day TTL)
                          can: search, view pairings, view science cards
                          cannot: submit ratings

Email-verified rater   → anonymous session + verified email in Redis session
                          email stored in localStorage post-verification (skip OTP on return)
                          can: submit ratings (up to 20/session)
                          cannot: cross-device sync, saved notebooks

Free (full account)    → Better Auth JWT + session (Pro upsell path)
Pro                    → Better Auth JWT + plan: 'pro' claim
Enterprise             → API key in Authorization header (hashed in Postgres)
```

#### Email Verification Flow (Rating Gate)
1. User taps "Rate this pairing"
2. Frontend checks `localStorage.flavorlab.rater_email`:
   - Present → pre-fill email, skip to step 5 (auto-verify from session)
   - Absent → show email capture modal
3. User submits email → `POST /api/v1/auth/email-otp/send`
4. Better Auth sends 6-digit OTP via Resend (TTL: 10 minutes)
5. User enters OTP → `POST /api/v1/auth/email-otp/verify`
6. Session upgraded: Redis session gains `{ raterEmail, raterVerifiedAt }` fields
7. Frontend stores email in `localStorage.flavorlab.rater_email`
8. Rating widget unlocks — user submits rating with verified email attached
9. **Follow-up:** 7 days after first rating, single "How was your experience?" email sent via BullMQ job (`feedback-request` queue). One email per address, ever.

**Email service:** Resend (`resend.com`) — free tier covers 3,000 emails/month (sufficient for MVP); React Email templates; simple SDK integration with NestJS.

Redis key added: `email-otp:{email}` → `{ otp, expiresAt }` (TTL 10 min, single-use — deleted on verify)
- NestJS `@Roles()` decorator + `RolesGuard` checks JWT `plan` claim
- Enterprise `ApiKeyStrategy` via Passport — separate from JWT flow
- API keys stored as bcrypt hashes; plaintext shown only at creation

#### Rate Limiting
- **Tool:** `@nestjs/throttler` with `@nestjs-throttler-storage-redis`
- Anonymous: 60 req/min per IP
- Free registered: 120 req/min per user token
- Enterprise `/public/v1/`: 1,000 req/min per API key (configurable per customer record)

#### Security Headers & CORS
- `helmet` middleware — OWASP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- CORS whitelist: `flavorlab.io` and `flavorlab.io/app` origins only
- All inputs validated via Zod pipes before any DB query
- Drizzle uses parameterised queries by default — no raw string interpolation

---

### API & Communication Patterns

#### API Documentation
- **Tool:** `@nestjs/swagger` — generates OpenAPI 3.0 spec from controller annotations
- `/api/docs` serves Swagger UI (internal, dev/staging only)
- `openapi.json` exported and committed — used to generate enterprise API reference docs

#### Error Response Standard
```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "error": "NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Ingredient 'foobar' not found",
  "requestId": "req_abc123",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-28T12:00:00Z"
}
```
- Implemented as a global NestJS `ExceptionFilter` applied to both API surfaces
- `requestId` from request-scoped UUID — links API response to structured log entry

#### Pagination
- **Strategy:** Cursor-based (not offset) for all list endpoints
- **Shape:** `{ data: [...], nextCursor: "base64string", hasMore: boolean }`
- **Rationale:** Offset pagination breaks with concurrent inserts; cursor-based is stable at 10M+ rating records

#### Real-time Updates
- **MVP strategy:** Client polls every 30s for Hive Score updates
- **Rationale:** Scoring recalc is ≤5 min debounced — real-time adds infrastructure complexity for marginal UX gain at MVP
- **Post-MVP:** SSE or WebSocket if user research validates the need

---

### Frontend Architecture

#### State Management
- **Server state:** TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) — caching, background refetch, loading/error states, stale-while-revalidate. Covers ingredient data, pairings, science cards, Hive Scores.
- **Client state:** Zustand — dietary filters, saved pairings list, UI panel states. Persisted to localStorage via `zustand/middleware`.
- **No Redux.** No Context API for data (Context only for theme).

#### Routing
- **Tool:** TanStack Router (`@tanstack/react-router`)
- Fully TypeScript-typed routes — route params are typed, no `useParams()` returning `string | undefined`
- File-based routing: `/app/ingredient/:canonicalName`, `/app/pairing/:id`, `/app/search`
- Integrates natively with TanStack Query for route-level data loading

#### Component Library
- **Tool:** shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind)
- Components are copied into the codebase (not an npm dependency) — no version lock-in, fully customisable
- Key components: science card, rating widget, autocomplete dropdown, dietary filter panel, skeleton loaders
- Design tokens from `--primary: #1B4332` and `--accent: #C8663B` mapped to Tailwind theme variables

#### CSS Approach
- **Tool:** Tailwind CSS v4 for product app
- Marketing page retains existing flat CSS — no change, no migration
- Tailwind v4 uses CSS-native cascade layers; no `tailwind.config.js` required
- Design tokens shared between marketing page and product app via CSS custom properties

#### Bundle Optimisation
- Science card content (compound explanations, citations) lazy-loaded via `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`
- Route-level code splitting via TanStack Router (automatic)
- Target: initial bundle < 150kB gzipped
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected on all animations (WCAG 2.1 AA requirement)

---

### Infrastructure & Deployment

#### Hosting
- **Platform:** Railway — supports Node.js long-running processes, managed Postgres with pgvector extension, managed Redis, custom domains, GitHub auto-deploy
- **Services:** `web` (Vite static), `api` (NestJS), `worker` (ETL + BullMQ), `postgres`, `redis`
- **Rationale:** Zero cost at MVP tier; single platform; upgrade path is paid Railway plans

#### Local Development
- Docker Compose for data services only (Postgres + pgvector + Redis)
- NestJS and Vite run natively on Node — faster DX than full containerisation

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  postgres:
    image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16
    ports: ["5432:5432"]
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: flavorlab_dev
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports: ["6379:6379"]
```

#### CI/CD
- **Tool:** GitHub Actions — free tier, runs on push to `main`
- Pipeline: typecheck → lint → unit tests → integration tests → build → deploy to Railway
- One workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

#### Environment Configuration
- `.env` files validated with Zod at app startup — missing required vars cause immediate crash with clear error
- Schema defined in `apps/api/src/config/env.schema.ts`, importable across packages

```typescript
const envSchema = z.object({
  DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  REDIS_URL: z.string().url(),
  BETTER_AUTH_SECRET: z.string().min(32),
  NODE_ENV: z.enum(['development', 'production', 'test'])
})
```

#### Reverse Proxy / Domain Routing
- **Tool:** Caddy (or Railway's built-in routing)
- `flavorlab.io/*` → static Vite build (marketing page)
- `flavorlab.io/app/*` → Vite SPA catch-all → `index.html`
- `flavorlab.io/api/*` → NestJS internal API (port 3000)
- `flavorlab.io/public/*` → NestJS enterprise API (port 3000, separate router prefix)

#### Logging
- **Tool:** `nestjs-pino` — structured JSON logs to stdout; Railway captures and indexes
- `requestId` propagated through request lifecycle for log correlation
- Full monitoring stack (Sentry + APM) deferred to post-launch sprint (post-mvp-tasks.md 5B)

---

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. Docker Compose data services + env schema validation (Sprint 0 — local dev foundation)
2. Drizzle schema + migrations (Sprint 1 — `confidence_tier` ENUM mandatory)
3. NestJS module scaffold + Zod pipes + ExceptionFilter (Sprint 1)
4. Better Auth + RolesGuard + rate limiting (Sprint 1 — before any endpoint goes live)
5. Ingredient search + autocomplete endpoints (Sprint 1 — core loop)
6. Vite React app + TanStack Router + TanStack Query (Sprint 1 — frontend core loop)
7. shadcn/ui skeleton states convention (Sprint 1 — established, not deferred)
8. Scoring engine pure function + BullMQ Hive Score jobs (Sprint 2)
9. Community ratings endpoints (Sprint 2)
10. `/public/v1/` enterprise API + ApiKeyStrategy (Sprint 3)
11. GitHub Actions CI/CD + Railway production deploy (Sprint 3)

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**
- Drizzle schema must exist before any NestJS service can query DB
- `confidence_tier` ENUM must be in schema before ETL pipeline imports data
- `@flavorlab/types` shared package must be initialised before frontend and backend can share type contracts
- Better Auth session table must exist before any authenticated endpoint is testable
- Redis must be running before rate limiting, caching, or BullMQ job queues work
- Scoring engine pure function must be complete before Hive Score BullMQ job can call it

**Feature folder rule:** Feature folders MUST match Drizzle table names (`ingredients`, `pairings`, `ratings`, `users`). Screens and pages are compositions — they live in `routes/`, not `features/`. No `features/search/`, `features/hero-demo/`, or `features/shared/`.

**`common/` rule:** Contains ONLY framework wiring that applies across multiple modules (Guards, Filters, Interceptors, Pipes, shared constants). Module-specific logic stays in the module. No business logic in `common/`.

#### NestJS Feature Module Structure (every module)

```
modules/{feature}/
├── {feature}.module.ts         # Imports, providers, exports
├── {feature}.controller.ts     # HTTP handlers only — no business logic
├── {feature}.service.ts        # Business logic — no HTTP concepts
├── {feature}.service.spec.ts   # Unit tests — co-located
├── dto/
│   ├── create-{feature}.dto.ts
│   └── {feature}-response.dto.ts
└── (optional) {feature}.consumer.ts  # BullMQ consumer if async jobs needed
```

#### React Feature Folder Structure (every feature)

```
features/{feature}/
├── components/                 # Feature-specific UI components
├── hooks/                      # Feature-specific React hooks
├── {feature}.api.ts            # TanStack Query hooks wrapping API calls
└── index.ts                    # Public API — only export what other features need
```

#### Constants: Three Categories, Three Locations

| Type | Location | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Environment config (changes per env) | `apps/api/src/config/env.schema.ts` | `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_TTL` |
| Algorithm invariants (scoring weights, limits) | `apps/api/src/modules/scoring/scoring.constants.ts` | `COMPOUND_AFFINITY_WEIGHT = 0.35` |
| Shared cross-module constants | `apps/api/src/common/constants.ts` | `MAX_PAIRINGS_PER_QUERY = 50` |

### Format Patterns

#### API Success Response Shape

```typescript
// Single resource
{ "data": { ...resource } }

// List resource
{
  "data": [...items],
  "nextCursor": "base64string | null",
  "hasMore": boolean,
  "total": number  // only when cheap to compute
}

// Mutation (create/update/delete) — always return the mutated resource
{ "data": { ...updatedResource } }
```

#### API Error Response Shape (global ExceptionFilter)

```typescript
{
  "statusCode": number,          // HTTP status code
  "error": "SCREAMING_SNAKE",    // Typed error code
  "message": string,             // Safe to display in UI — never a stack trace
  "requestId": string,           // UUID for log correlation
  "timestamp": string            // ISO 8601 UTC
}
```

#### Pairing Response — `confidenceSummary` Required Field

Every pairing API response MUST include `confidenceSummary` — the minimum confidence tier across all compound associations for that pairing. This is the science honesty contract made visible in the API.

```typescript
{
  "data": {
    "id": "garlic:rosemary",
    "ingredientA": "garlic",
    "ingredientB": "rosemary",
    "scienceScore": 0.84,
    "confidenceSummary": "LITERATURE_CURATED",  // min tier — NEVER omitted
    "compounds": [...],
    ...
  }
}
```

`confidenceSummary` is computed in the service layer (not controller), derived as `MIN(confidence_tier)` across joined compound associations.

#### JSON Field Naming

- All API responses use `camelCase` — no exceptions
- DB stores `snake_case`; Drizzle `.$inferSelect` returns `snake_case`
- **Serialisation:** Zod transform at the service boundary converts to `camelCase` — compile-time safety, not runtime `ClassSerializerInterceptor` (which fails silently if forgotten)

#### Date/Time

- Always ISO 8601 with UTC: `"2026-03-28T12:00:00.000Z"`
- Zod transform: `z.date().transform(d => d.toISOString())` on all date fields
- Frontend displays in user's local timezone via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
- Never Unix timestamps in API responses

#### Pagination Rule

Paginate if and only if the result set can exceed 50 items in production. Return all items for bounded sets (dietary filter options ≤ 20, confidence tier enum ≤ 4). Default page size: 20 items.

---

### Communication Patterns

#### BullMQ Job Naming

| Convention | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Queue names | `kebab-case` | `hive-score-recalc`, `etl-seed` |
| Job names | `{domain}.{verb}` | `pairing.recalculate-score`, `etl.seed-ingredients` |
| Job payloads | Typed interface in `shared-types` | `RecalculateScoreJob { pairingId: string }` |
| Retry config | On every job definition | `{ attempts: 3, backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 1000 } }` |

**Typed queue wrapper** — use a generic `Queue<TPayload>` wrapper in `common/` to enforce payload types at compile time. Never pass untyped objects to `job.add()`.

#### NestJS Internal Domain Events

- Event names: `{domain}.{past-tense-verb}` — `rating.submitted`, `pairing.score-updated`
- Payload: always a typed class imported from `shared-types`
- Used for decoupling within the API process: rating submitted → event → BullMQ enqueues job

#### TanStack Query Key Factory

All query keys use the centralised factory in `apps/web/src/lib/query-keys.ts`. No ad-hoc inline `queryKey: ['...']` arrays — ESLint rule enforced.

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/query-keys.ts
export const queryKeys = {
  ingredients: {
    all: ['ingredients'] as const,
    search: (q: string) => ['ingredients', 'search', q] as const,
    detail: (id: string) => ['ingredients', 'detail', id] as const,
  },
  pairings: {
    forIngredient: (id: string) => ['pairings', 'ingredient', id] as const,
    detail: (id: string) => ['pairings', 'detail', id] as const,
  },
  ratings: {
    forPairing: (id: string) => ['ratings', 'pairing', id] as const,
  }
}
```

#### Zustand Store Pattern

```typescript
// All stores follow this shape — state + actions co-located
interface FilterStore {
  activeFilters: DietaryFilter[]
  setFilter: (filter: DietaryFilter) => void
  clearFilters: () => void
}

// Always use selective subscriptions — never subscribe to full store
const activeFilters = useFilterStore(state => state.activeFilters) // ✅
const store = useFilterStore()  // ❌ — causes re-render on any state change
```

---

### Process Patterns

#### Error Handling — Backend

```typescript
// Services throw typed NestJS exceptions — NEVER return null for "not found"
throw new NotFoundException(`Ingredient '${name}' not found`)
throw new BadRequestException('RECIPE_CO_OCCURRENCE cannot contribute to Science Score')
throw new ConflictException('Rating already submitted for this pairing today')

// Global ExceptionFilter formats ALL exceptions into the standard error shape
// Controllers and services NEVER format HTTP responses directly
```

#### Error Handling — Frontend

```typescript
// ALWAYS destructure error.response.data.message — the safe ExceptionFilter field
// NEVER use error.message — may contain stack traces or DB query fragments (security risk)
const message = error.response?.data?.message ?? 'Something went wrong'

// TanStack Query error boundary at route level, not per-component
// Component-level errors show inline error state with retry button
const { data, isLoading, error } = usePairingData(ingredientId)
if (isLoading) return <PairingSkeleton />         // Skeleton, never spinner
if (error) return <PairingError onRetry={refetch} /> // Inline error with retry
return <PairingList pairings={data} />
```

#### Loading States — The Skeleton Contract

Every component that fetches async data MUST export a co-located skeleton:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct — skeleton co-located and exported
export function ScienceCard({ pairing }: Props) { ... }
export function ScienceCardSkeleton() {
  return <div className="animate-pulse rounded-lg bg-gray-100 h-48 w-full" />
}

// ❌ Anti-pattern
if (isLoading) return <Spinner />        // Never
if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div> // Never
if (isLoading) return null               // Never
```

#### Validation — Three Layers, Each Owns Its Boundary

```
Frontend (Zod + TanStack Form): Validate on blur + submit, never on keystroke
Backend (Zod pipe):             Validate at controller entry, before any service call
DB (Drizzle + Postgres):        Enforce invariants that must survive direct DB access
```

Each layer validates what it owns. No layer skips its responsibility.

#### Test Pyramid — Explicit Scope

| Layer | Tool | What it tests | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Vitest | Scoring engine (pure function), Zod schemas, utility functions | Every PR |
| Integration | NestJS test module + test Postgres | Every service method that touches DB or Redis | Every PR |
| E2E | Playwright | The 5 critical user journeys only (search → pairing, rate, science card, autocomplete, dietary filter) | Pre-release |

Rule: Do not write E2E tests for things covered by integration tests. Do not write integration tests for things covered by unit tests.

#### Retry Policy

- API requests (TanStack Query): Default 3 retries with exponential backoff. Override to 0 retries for non-idempotent mutations (`POST /ratings`).
- BullMQ jobs: `{ attempts: 3, backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 1000 } }` on every job definition.
- ETL scripts: Idempotent by design — can be re-run at any time; no retry complexity needed.

### Enforcement Guidelines

**All AI agents MUST:**

1. Feature folders match Drizzle table names — no screen-named feature folders
2. Use query key factory from `src/lib/query-keys.ts` — no inline query key arrays
3. Throw typed NestJS exceptions from services — no `return null` for not-found
4. Export a skeleton component alongside every data-fetching component
5. `camelCase` in all JSON responses — no `snake_case` leaking via Zod transform
6. Keep NestJS controllers thin — zero business logic in controllers
7. Keep scoring engine free of NestJS/Drizzle imports — pure TypeScript function
8. Use `confidence_tier` ENUM values only as defined — no string literals elsewhere
9. Every pairing API response includes `confidenceSummary` — computed in service
10. `shared-types` is a leaf node — no imports from `apps/web` or `apps/api`
11. Frontend error display uses `error.response.data.message` only — never `error.message`
12. `common/` contains framework wiring only — no business logic
13. Constants in their correct location (env config / module-local / `common/constants.ts`)
14. `any` type forbidden in business logic — `unknown` + assertion allowed at NestJS framework boundaries (Guards, Interceptors, lifecycle hooks)

**Anti-patterns to reject in PR review:**
- `any` in service or DTO code
- Direct `fetch()` calls in React components (always TanStack Query)
- `console.log` in production code (use `nestjs-pino` logger in API; no logging in frontend)
- Inline styles in React (always Tailwind classes)
- `ClassSerializerInterceptor` for camelCase conversion (use Zod transform instead)
- Spinner/blank div/null for loading states (always skeleton)
- `error.message` in frontend error display (always `error.response.data.message`)
- Inline `queryKey: ['ingredients', id]` arrays (always query key factory)

**PR Checklist** (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`):
- [ ] Skeleton component exported alongside every new async component
- [ ] Query key factory used — no inline query key arrays
- [ ] Controller is logic-free (service handles all business logic)
- [ ] Zod validation pipe on all new endpoints
- [ ] New BullMQ jobs have typed payloads and retry config
- [ ] `confidenceSummary` included in all pairing responses
- [ ] No `any` types in business logic or DTOs

## Project Structure & Boundaries

### Requirements → Architecture Mapping

| FR Domain | NestJS Module | Frontend Feature | Shared Types |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 Search + autocomplete | `modules/ingredients/` | `features/ingredients/` | `Ingredient`, `AutocompleteResult` |
| FR-02 Pairing results + Science Score | `modules/pairings/` + `modules/scoring/` | `features/pairings/` | `Pairing`, `ScienceScore`, `ScienceCard` |
| FR-03 Community ratings | `modules/ratings/` | `features/ratings/` | `Rating`, `RatingEvent` |
| FR-04 Hive Score recalc | `modules/ratings/` (BullMQ consumer) | `features/pairings/` (display) | `HiveScore`, `RecalculateScoreJob` |
| FR-05 Saved ingredients | — (localStorage only) | `features/saved/` (Zustand) | `SavedIngredient` |
| FR-06 Dietary filters | — (frontend filtering) | `features/ingredients/` (filter panel) | `DietaryFilter` |
| FR-07 Mobile responsive | — (CSS/Tailwind) | all components | — |
| FR-08 Provenance tracking | all modules (`confidence_tier` field) | `features/pairings/` (science card) | `ConfidenceTier`, `SourceCitation` |
| FR-09 Personalised discovery | `modules/ingredients/` (recommendations) | `features/ingredients/` | `DiscoveryCard` |
| FR-10 Pro chef's notebook | `modules/notebooks/` (post-MVP) | `features/notebooks/` (post-MVP) | `Notebook`, `NotebookEntry` |
| FR-11 Enterprise API | `enterprise/v1/` controllers | — (B2B consumers) | `PublicPairingResponse` |

**Cross-domain feature rule:** If a feature derives primarily from one domain entity (no new DB table), it lives in that entity's module as a method — e.g. `IngredientsService.findSubstitutes()`. If a feature spans two entities equally AND has its own DB table, it gets its own module.

### Architectural Boundaries

#### API Routing

```
External requests
       │
       ▼
[Caddy / Railway routing]
       │
       ├── flavorlab.io/*             → Static Vite build (marketing page — vanilla JS, unchanged)
       ├── flavorlab.io/app/*         → SPA catch-all → web/dist/index.html

       └── flavorlab.io/public/v1/*   → NestJS api process — enterprise API (same process, different router prefix)
```

**Internal API (`/api/v1/`)** — presentation-optimised, session auth, 60–120 req/min
**Enterprise API (`/public/v1/`)** — data-contract-stable, API key auth, 1,000 req/min per key, versioned subdirectories (`v1/`, `v2/` alongside)

#### Service Boundaries

├── CacheService         → wraps ioredis get/set/del/ttl

ETL process (separate Node.js process — not NestJS at MVP)
└── pipeline/ → OntologyService → transformers → Drizzle upserts (idempotent)
    scripts/  → one-off data operations (never imported by pipeline/)

#### Data Boundaries

├── compounds            flavor molecules, aroma families, PubChem IDs
├── pairing_edges        35,440 chemical edges; confidence_tier ENUM; hive_score; score_version
├── pairing_signals      5 signal values stored separately per edge
├── rating_events        raw community ratings; rater_email (NOT NULL); immutable — never deleted

└── flavorlab.rater_email            Verified rater email — skips OTP on return visits
```

### Data Flow

```
User types "gar" → autocomplete
  IngredientSearch → useAutocomplete → TanStack Query [queryKeys.ingredients.search('gar')]
  → GET /api/v1/ingredients/autocomplete?q=gar
  → IngredientsService → Redis HIT → return / MISS → in-memory prefix index → Redis SET → return

User selects "garlic" → pairings load
  → TanStack Query [queryKeys.pairings.forIngredient('garlic')]
  → GET /api/v1/ingredients/garlic/pairings
  → PairingsService → Redis MISS → Drizzle JOIN → confidenceSummary computed
  → Zod transform snake_case → camelCase → Redis SET → return {data, nextCursor, hasMore}

User taps rate (not yet verified)
  → Frontend checks localStorage.flavorlab.rater_email → absent
  → Email capture modal → POST /api/v1/auth/email-otp/send {email}
  → Better Auth → Resend sends 6-digit OTP (10 min TTL)
  → User enters OTP → POST /api/v1/auth/email-otp/verify {email, otp}
  → Redis session upgraded: session:{token} gains { raterEmail, raterVerifiedAt }
  → Frontend stores email in localStorage.flavorlab.rater_email
  → Rating widget unlocks

User submits rating (verified)
  → POST /api/v1/ratings (0 retries — non-idempotent)
  → RatingsService reads raterEmail from session → validates email present
  → Drizzle INSERT rating_events (rater_email NOT NULL)
  → EventEmitter: rating.submitted
  → BullMQ enqueue: pairing.recalculate-score {pairingId}
  → BullMQ enqueue: feedback-request {email, firstRatingAt} (fires 7 days later, once per email)
  → Redis DEL versioned cache key → return {data: {id, value, createdAt}}

BullMQ worker (async, ≤5 min debounced)
  → ScoringService → engine/index.ts (pure fn) → new HiveScore
  → Drizzle UPDATE pairing_edges SET hive_score, score_version
  → Redis SET new versioned cache key
```

### Integration Points

**Internal communication:**
- `shared-types` — consumed by both apps via pnpm workspace path references
- `rating.submitted` NestJS event — decouples RatingsService from ScoringService
- BullMQ `hive-score-recalc` queue (Redis-backed) — decouples API request from scoring computation

**External integrations:**
- Better Auth — self-hosted on existing Postgres
- PubChem API — ETL enrichment only (not runtime)
- Railway — managed Postgres (pgvector extension enabled), Redis, Node.js services, GitHub auto-deploy
- GitHub Actions — CI/CD on push to `main`

**Test infrastructure:**
- `docker-compose.test.yml` — Postgres on 5433, Redis on 6380 (never the dev database)
- `test/fixtures/seed-test-db.ts` — runs Drizzle migrations + inserts shared fixtures before integration tests
- Integration tests: `apps/api/test/integration/` — NestJS test module against test DB
- E2E tests: `apps/api/test/e2e/` — Playwright against 5 critical journeys only

## Architecture Validation Results

_Step-07: All sections reviewed against PRD requirements; Advanced Elicitation + Party Mode protocols applied._

### Validation Summary

All 11 functional requirements, 8 non-functional requirements, and 12 design rules from the PRD are mapped and addressed. Two critical gaps were identified and resolved during validation.

---

### Gap Findings & Resolutions

#### GAP-01 — `cuisine_context` column missing from schema (CRITICAL)

**Source:** Party Mode — PRD cross-cutting concern 4 (geographic context flags) was never translated into a Drizzle schema column.

**Resolution:** Add `cuisine_context` pgEnum and column to `pairing-edges.schema.ts`:

```typescript
// apps/api/src/modules/pairings/schemas/pairing-edges.schema.ts
export const cuisineContextEnum = pgEnum('cuisine_context', [
  'WESTERN_VALIDATED',
  'EAST_ASIAN_CONTRADICTED',
  'NOT_VALIDATED',
  'CONTEXT_DEPENDENT',
]);

// In pairingEdges table definition:
cuisineContext: cuisineContextEnum('cuisine_context')
  .notNull()
  .default('NOT_VALIDATED'),
```

**Impact:** `cuisineContext` is a required field in `pairing-response.dto.ts`. ETL defaults all new pairings to `NOT_VALIDATED`. Frontend Science Card displays context badge when value is not `NOT_VALIDATED`.

---

#### GAP-02 — `confidenceSummary` null fallback undefined

**Source:** Advanced Elicitation — what is the `confidenceSummary` when a pairing has zero compound associations?

**Resolution:** When `compound_associations` is empty for a pairing, `confidenceSummary` defaults to `'RECIPE_CO_OCCURRENCE'` (the lowest confidence tier). This is semantically correct — a pairing with no compound evidence is effectively recipe co-occurrence only.

**Implementation location:** `PairingsService.computeConfidenceSummary()` — explicit `?? 'RECIPE_CO_OCCURRENCE'` fallback.

---

#### GAP-03 — Better Auth migration order

**Source:** Advanced Elicitation — Sprint 0 bootstrap sequence not documented.

**Resolution:** Better Auth creates its own tables (`account`, `session`, `verification`) using its own migration runner. These must be created **before** Drizzle migrations run, because Drizzle schemas may reference Better Auth user IDs.

**Sprint 0 sequence in `apps/api/src/main.ts`:**
1. `await betterAuth.migrate()` — creates Better Auth tables
2. `await drizzle.migrate()` — creates application tables (may FK to Better Auth `user.id`)
3. Start NestJS application

---

#### GAP-04 — Redis eviction policy conflicts with BullMQ

**Source:** Advanced Elicitation — `noeviction` policy causes BullMQ writes to OOM-fail silently under memory pressure.

**Resolution:**
- Railway Redis config: `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`
- BullMQ uses isolated key namespace: `bull:` prefix (configured via `defaultJobOptions.prefix`)
- Cache keys use versioned TTL patterns: `fl:v{N}:{type}:{id}` with explicit `EX` on every SET

---

#### GAP-05 — `confidence_tier` NOT NULL constraint not enforced at DB layer

**Source:** Advanced Elicitation — schema had enum type but no `NOT NULL` constraint documented.

**Resolution:** Both `confidence_tier` and `cuisine_context` columns have `.notNull()` in Drizzle schema. This means:
- ETL must always provide a value (no silent nulls from CSV gaps)
- Drizzle `.$inferSelect` type will be the enum string (not `string | null`)
- Query results never need null-guards for these fields

---

#### GAP-06 — Canonical ingredient name aliases not tracked

**Source:** Advanced Elicitation — "garlic" vs "Allium sativum" vs "ajo" must resolve to the same ingredient node.

**Resolution:** `ingredients` table has:
- `canonical_name` — the display name (e.g. "Garlic")
- `aliases: text[]` — searchable variants (e.g. `['garlic', 'Allium sativum', 'ajo', 'knoblauch']`)
- GIN index on `aliases` for efficient `@>` array containment queries
- Autocomplete searches `canonical_name ILIKE` first, then `aliases @>` for exact matches

---

#### GAP-07 — Session middleware not in project structure

**Source:** Party Mode — `session.middleware.ts` was missing from the step-06 directory tree.

**Resolution:** Added to `apps/api/src/middleware/`:

```
apps/api/src/middleware/
└── session.middleware.ts     # UUID v4 anonymous token; HTTP-only SameSite=Lax cookie; Redis TTL 30d
```

Session middleware behaviour:
- Issues UUID v4 anonymous session token on **first request to any endpoint**
- Stores in Redis with 30-day sliding TTL
- Sets HTTP-only, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` (prod) cookie
- All rating and preference operations tagged with session ID
- No re-issue if valid session cookie present

---

### ETL Upsert Pattern (Enforcement Rule)

**Source:** Advanced Elicitation — ETL re-runs on data updates must be idempotent.

**Rule:** All ETL insert operations use `onConflictDoUpdate` — **never** plain `insert`. This applies to:
- `seed.ts` (initial seed)
- `scripts/YYYYMMDD-*.ts` (incremental updates)
- Any future pipeline additions

```typescript
// Pattern: always upsert, never insert-or-fail
await db.insert(ingredients)
  .values(rows)
  .onConflictDoUpdate({
    target: ingredients.canonicalName,
    set: { aliases: sql`excluded.aliases`, updatedAt: sql`now()` },
  });
```

---

### HNSW Index Specification

**Source:** Advanced Elicitation — ivfflat requires training data at index creation; HNSW builds incrementally.

**Final decision:** `pgvector` HNSW index (not ivfflat) on `ingredient_embeddings.embedding`:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON ingredient_embeddings
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

Rationale: HNSW works at any dataset size, no training phase, better recall at MVP scale. ivfflat revisited at 100k+ vectors if needed.
